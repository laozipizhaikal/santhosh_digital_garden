In economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good) is a good that is both [[Notes/Non-Excludable\|Non-Excludable]] and [[Notes/Non-Rivalrous\|Non-Rivalrous]].

"public goods such as clean air are underproduced by the free market." ([Kelkar and Shah 2019:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EW52ATBW?page=19))

"public goods are things that are 'non-rival' and 'non-excludable'." ([Kelkar and Shah 2019:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EW52ATBW?page=19))

"It is not possible to exclude any person from the benefits. Excludability is essential for firms to obtain a revenue stream" ([Kelkar and Shah 2019:20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EW52ATBW?page=20))
