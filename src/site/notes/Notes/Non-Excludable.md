**Excludability** is defined as the degree to which a good, service or resource can be limited to only paying customers, or conversely, the degree to which a supplier, producer or other managing body (e.g. a government) can prevent "free" consumption of a good.

“Non-excludability” means that the cost of keeping nonpayers from enjoying the benefits of the good or service is prohibitive.
