# 5 Ways to Philosophize Something
The philosophical core of a issue is 
- one that is **Universal**
	from personal questions to life questions - humanity 
- one that is **Perennial** 
- one that is **Essential**
- one that differentiates the topic from others - **Micro-differentiation** 
- one that can expressed as a **language expression** - செறிவான மொழி - [[Notes/Bertrand Russell\|Bertrand Russell]]
