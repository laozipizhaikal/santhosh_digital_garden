**Subsidiarity**Â is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate (or local) level that is consistent with their resolution.

*that no public agency should do what a private agency can do better, and that no higher-level public agency should attempt to do what a lower-level agency can do better* - [[Fergus Reid Buckley\|Fergus Reid Buckley]] 

The principle of subsidiarity, which was developed as part of Catholic Social Teaching, states: *What individuals can accomplish by their own initiative and efforts should not be taken from them by a higher authority. A greater and higher social institution must not take over the duties of subordinate organizations and deprive it of its competence. Its purpose, rather, is to intervene in a subsidiary fashion (thus offering help) when individuals or smaller institutions find that a task is beyond them*. - YOUCAT 323
