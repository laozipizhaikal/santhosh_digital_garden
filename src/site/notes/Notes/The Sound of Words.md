# The Sound of Words

Subconsciously we are reading aloud in our head 
Words are sound 
All writing is music
When u read u are focused on the meaning and the music of the words is background music
if the music is discordant or jangly, the reader will walk away

 Shakespeare used Iambic Pentameter

# Pentameter

'Penta' means five, so pentameter simply means five meters. A line of poetry written in iambic pentameter has five feet = five sets of stressed syllables and unstressed syllables.

 Putting these two terms together, iambic pentameter is a line of writing that consists of ten syllables in a specific pattern of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable, or a short syllable followed by a long syllable.
