# Logos

Logos, or the appeal to logic, means to appeal to the audiences' sense of reason or logic. Logos can also be thought of as the text of the argument. 

To use logos, the author makes clear, logical connections between ideas, and includes the use of facts and statistics. Using historical and literal analogies to make a logical argument is another strategy. There are also more traditional forms of logical reasoning such as [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism") and [enthymemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthymeme "Enthymeme") 

There should be no holes in the argument, also known as logical fallacies, which are unclear or wrong assumptions or connections between ideas.

Aristotle had a tip here: He found that the most effective use of _logos_ is to encourage your audience to reach the conclusion to your argument on their own, just moments before your big reveal.
