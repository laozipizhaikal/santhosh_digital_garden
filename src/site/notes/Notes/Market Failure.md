Where the free market fails to deliver efficient economic outcomes, this is termed **Market Failure**. Market failures come in four kinds:
- [[Notes/Externalities\|Externalities]],
- [[Notes/Asymmetric Information\|Asymmetric Information]],
- [[Notes/Market Power\|Market Power]] and
- [[Notes/Public goods\|Public goods]]

The essence of market failure is the channels of influence between two persons which are not governed by negotiations and choice: 
- **Market power**: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
- **Asymmetric Information**: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
- **Externalities**: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
- **Public goods**: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.
