# Leontief Paradox

Leontief's paradox in economics is that a country with a higher capital per worker has a lower capital/labor ratio in exports than in imports.

The [[Notes/Heckscher-Ohlin theorem\|Heckscher-Ohlin theorem]] gave a generalisation that the capital-abundant counties tend to export capital-intensive goods while labourabundant countries tend to export the labourintensive goods. W.W. Leontief put this generalisation to empirical test in 1953 and found the results that were contrary â€“ to the generalisation provided by the H-O theory.
