1950's next jump - integrated circuit

# whats new
- because of this fast growth in the semiconductor technology we have certain expectation about electronics that we do not have for anything else 
- Fragmentation of the supply chain - unbundling.. 
	- design company handover blueprint - HR intensive 
	- manufacture - wafer  
	- assembly test and packaging - labour intensive
- Civil technologies are far more cutting edge than military one 
# Geopolitical
- tech is a big source of power in the information age, so beating progress in tech is an important goal 
- peculiarities of the supply chain makes it useful as a tool to restrict another country's industry
- Taiwan's centrality and vulnerability
- Hardware espionage 
# Geoeconomic imperative
- concentration risks and business continuity risks
