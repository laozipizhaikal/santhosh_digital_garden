#AjayKhana

Shift from network lobbyist to knowledge lobbyist.. who you know vs what u know.. 

Context to Content - companies are focusing to be part of a conversation 

# Advocacy
Lobbying - Individual company issue 
Public Policy  - larger industry issue

- if you shift advocacy from individual to sector to industry wide issue -> government is more receptive 
- Do through coalition - industry body - get people around the issue - *more effective for a new policy proposal*
- Build long term relationships - art of networking 
- Thinking ahead
- Thought leadership - creating a narrative - white paper etc
- **Messaging and medium** - never talk to the government through media 

# Person
-  work across the hierarchy..
- flexibility 
- entrepreneurial sprit - proactive and not 
- Networking skills 
- Hunger for knowledge 

Retain institutional knowledge vs individual knowledge
- four eye principle 
- SOPs
