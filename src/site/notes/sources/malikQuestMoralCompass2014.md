# The Quest for a Moral Compass
> [!Abstract]
> _The story of the global search for moral truths In this remarkable and groundbreaking book, Kenan Malik explores the history of moral thought as it has developed over three millennia, from Homer's Greece to Mao's China, from ancient India to modern America. It tells the stories of the great philosophers, and breathes life into their ideas, while also challenging many of our most cherished moral beliefs. Engaging and provocative, The Quest for a Moral Compass confronts some of humanity's deepest questions. Where do values come from? Is God necessary for moral guidance? Are there absolute moral truths? It also brings morality down to earth, showing how, throughout history, social needs and political desires have shaped moral thinking. It is a history of the world told through the history of moral thought, and a history of moral thought that casts new light on global history._**Extracted Annotations (11/19/2022, 4:41:57 AM)**

"distinguishable.societies, and especially in 'heroic' societies at the edge of historical records such as that which Homer describes, the structure of society is a given, as is the role that each individual occupies and the privileges and duties that derive from that role. A person knows who he is by knowing his role within society, and in knowing this he knows also what he owes and what is owed to him by every other individual" ([Malik 2014:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=17))

"ners and slaves were, for instance,s all disbarred from governance. mpulse that 'rule by the many' was better than 'rule by the few', an impulse that was to shape all progressive thought in the centuries that followed" ([Malik 2014:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=22))

"ernal. the sixth century BCE, a new kind of moral account began to develop in which ideas about what constituted a virtuous act or a good life were not implicitly crafted, and intuitively grasped, through the narrative of myth, but explicitly established through rational argument. These new accounts did not so much tell stories as ask questions." ([Malik 2014:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=24))

Naturalistic because phenomena had to be explained without recourse to divine intervention but only by reference to natural causes and events; reductionist because complex phenomena could be understood in terms of simpler processes, and explanations of the world should rely on as few principles as possible" ([Malik 2014:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=26))

"In Plato's world, notions of the inner self were barely articulated, an individual's identity and interest were bound up entirely with the community in which he lived, the very notion of the individual was far more constrained than it is today, and ethics was a means of regulating the social roles and relationships within a community."

"rtue'.Aristotle, as for Plato, ethics was subordinate to politics. The primary good was the good of the community rather than the good of the individual. Moral rules grew out of the structure of the community, and ensured the maintenance of that structure" ([Malik 2014:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=53))

"ealize Sparta, a city that despised the freedoms granted by Athens.t we now call 'virtue theory', establishing the importance of character, community, ourishing and practical wisdom as the central themes of a virtuous life. This became the dominant ethical view over the next two millennia. Not till the eighteenth century did competing ethical frameworks develop in Kantianism and utilitarianism, the rst stressing the importance of duty and conscience, the second the signicance of the consequences of one's actions" ([Malik 2014:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=57))

"at he presents to Moses.and harmony were experienced in the very nature of the universe (kosmos meant to the Greeks both the physical universe and a sense of order and harmony).

"more as a means of educating the mind than of observing a law. from on high the laws inscribed in tablets of stone for all to obey. There was no discovery here, nor crafting, simply the Revelation of God's will, the disclosing of truth to, and through, a prophet."

"m which both Christianity and Islam were later to bee constructed. new kind of ethics. Every Jew, Christian and Muslim believed - and still believes - that the nature of God and of the relationship between Man and God denes the moral rules by which we live. What is striking about the monotheistic religions, though, is that they combine an unyielding attachment to God's word with an immensely exible understanding of what those words mean." ([Malik 2014:73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=73))

"ilty.moral codes possess two elements: a set of values to pursue and a reason for pursuing those values; or, to put it another way, they both elucidate the means of being good and demonstrate the end to which the means take us. In ancient Greece, the virtuous life was the means. The end - the reason for submitting to such a life - changed over time. For Homer the prize was honour, for Plato justice, for Aristotle happiness." ([Malik 2014:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=75))

It is an ethics that emerges, however, less through reasoning about the good life than by unconditionally embracing God's love." ([Malik 2014:79](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=79))

Christians eventually had to take a set of ethics crafted for the end of the world and transform it into one applicable for societies still stuck in history. This only deepened disagreements about how to read Jesus' words. God's word it may have been, but that word had to be read, interpreted and translated into deeds by mere mortals. The moral compass may have, in Christian eyes, derived from God, but it was humans who had to decide which way lay moral North." ([Malik 2014:80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=80))

"had felt humiliated by the betrayal, torture and execution of Christ.e Kingdom of God have been left to die as a common criminal, nailed to a cross and in bestial pain? It was Paul who began to sketch an answer. The very nature of Jesus' death, Paul argued, revealed the essential goodness of God. Jesus had been willing to die in such an unspeakable fashion to atone for human sins, revealing an unconditional love for humankind."

"red heretics and banished from Rome. In thef struggle between n thought, two contradictory views of God, salvation and human nature that Christianity has never truly resolved. On the one hand an embrace of a loving God, on the other a sense of terror at God's wrath and vengeance; on the one hand an understanding of humans as moral agents possessed of free will and capable of good works, on the other a condemnation of humans as corrupted sinners, incapable without God's grace of telling right from wrong or acting upon it; on the one hand a belief in the Law as God's gift to humankind that called forth the moral responsibility without which believers could not enter the Kingdom of God, on the other an insistence that not through adherence to the Law but only through faith in Jesus Christ could salvation be realized."

"as unnerved by Pelagius and his disruptive theology. developed a theology of authority and order. 'It is in the natural order of things', he preached, 'that women should serve men, and children their parents, because this is just in itself, that the weaker reason should serve the stronger.' As with family, so with society. It was given by nature for the lower orders to serve the upper orders, and for all to serve the emperor. Slavery, too, was 'ordained as a punishment by that law which enjoins the preservation of the order of nature, and forbids its disturbance'.27 War, repression and the torture even of innocent men28 were all acceptable to compel obedience and to secure order. But while the rulers of a society could take punitive action to defend social peace, individuals had no such right. In Augustine, the theologian John Rist observes, 'the powers of ordinary citizens are almost non-" ([Malik 2014:92](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=92))

"the existence of free will made social renewal an imperative. humans had to follow authority, whether that of God, bishops or the emperor" ([Malik 2014:93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=93))

"eir history has been their importance as a bedrock oft moral values. our moral truths or truly know right from wrong. Without belief in God we will be lost in a miasma of moral nihilism. Yet the transformation in the rst four centuries not just in the fortunes of Christianity but also in the ethical ideas that animated it reveals the exibility of religious precepts."

Indeed, fate as a social phenomenon is justied by free will as a metaphysical claim. Your life cannot be otherwise because of past karma. Free will in the past becomes, in other words, an explanation for fatedness in the present" ([Malik 2014:102](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=102))

"ditional Indian philosophy.middle centuries of the rst millennium BCE is that a similar kind of social turbulence should beset all the great civilizational centres of the world. Not just in India, but in Greece, Israel, Persia and China, too, the heroic age was giving way to a more structured world at around the same time." ([Malik 2014:106](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=106))

"en projected back to establish a canonical text.ng of the Wheel of Dharma' are the Four Noble Truths. The rst truth is that the world is permeated with suering, or duhkha, a concept that refers not just" ([Malik 2014:108](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=108))

"to pain and sorrow but also to dissatisfaction and unfullment. Duhkha is one of the Three Marks of Existence (trilakshana), or features of earthly life. They stamp our lives so indelibly that those who ignore their reality will nd nirvana always to be beyond their reach. The other Marks of Existence are anitya, or impermanence, and anatman, meaning 'no self' or 'egolessness'. Anitya expresses the belief that everything in the phenomenal world is in a state of ux. This includes human beings themselves. Hence anatman, or lack of self. All human existence, for the Buddha, is a series of discontinuous moments. The image he presents is of a row of unlit candles. The rst candle is lit, used to light the second, but is itself then extinguished; and so on it continues down the row. Human existence, too, consists of a series of moments, lit up and snued out. Each moment of consciousness gives birth to the next and then ceases to be, so no person is constant from one moment to the next. For Buddhists, the belief that humans possess a self, that there is an essential 'me', is part of the illusion of permanence that must be discarded if an individual is to achieve enlightenment" ([Malik 2014:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=109))

"scarded if an individual is to achieve enlightenment.he cause of all suering is human desire, the thirst for that which cannot satisfy, including the desire to be a self. Originally a place of bliss, the world had been reduced to a place of suering by human capitulation to desire, a sentiment that was, half a millennium later, to be echoed in certain strands of Christian thought, though in Buddhism the cause of degradation is not sin, as in Christianity, but ignorance. Suering can only be ended through renunciation of all desire, the third of the Noble Truths. Renunciation of desire is the path to nirvana, or liberation from rebirth, the Buddhist version of the Hindu idea of moksha. Like Hindus, Buddhists believe in the cycle of birth, death and rebirth in a new form that is the inevitable burden of human life. Only through enlightenment - moksha or nirvana - can one break that endless cycle. What rebirth means when one does not possess a self, and when every individual's life lacks continuity from one moment to the next, let alone from one birth to the next, is a conundrum that Buddhists have endlessly debated, and upon which arguments have endlessly foundered." ([Malik 2014:109](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=109))

"The fourth Noble Truth upon which Buddha insisted was that desire can only be renounced through following the 'Eightfold Path', eight principles of actions that lead to a balanced, moderate life. These include the acceptance of the Four Noble Truths; the resolve to live according to the Buddhist way; the wisdom to adopt the right kind of livelihood, rejecting, for instance, jobs that involve killing, such as being a butcher, a hunter or a soldier; and the determination to act ethically by avoiding stealing, prohibited sexual activity, unjust speech and intoxicating drinks." ([Malik 2014:110](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=110))

"to overplay the rational and humanistic quality ofe Buddhism. otle, the Buddha did not view ethics as a means of building the good life on this Earth, but rather as a means of escaping the bad life of this Earth. His teachings embody an intensely pessimistic view of the world as a place of unremitting hurt and disappointment. Suering without end in a futile round of rebirths after rebirths - that is the fate of most mortals. Escape comes through nirvana."

"shall see, Islam all arose in times of great social dislocation, when the foundations of traditional ethics no longer appeared sure. God seemed essential to many as a source of moral concrete." ([Malik 2014:112](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=112))

"d this takes us to the, second of the two pivots of Confucian ethics, ion, ritual and conventional mores. 'If one is courteous but does without ritual, then one dissipates one's energy,' Kong suggested; 'if one is cautious but does without ritual, then one becomes timid; if one is bold but does without ritual, then one becomes reckless; if one is forthright but does without ritual, then one becomes rude.'4" ([Malik 2014:118](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=118))

"o to argue for the opposite. two principles: that of 'partiality' and that of 'universality'. Someone who held to the principle of partiality, as Kong did, discounted the moral interests of other tribes or other states, or hated or despised them because they were of other tribes or other states. To adopt the principle of 'universality' did not mean, as some have suggested of Mo, that one should love strangers as much as one loves one's family, but rather that the moral interests of strangers, and of other tribes and states, must concern us as much as those of our family, that one should 'regard others' states as though regarding one's state, regard others' families" ([Malik 2014:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=121))

"as though regarding one's family, and regard other persons as though regarding one's person'" ([Malik 2014:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=122))

"rticularly in the premodern world. was also something quite authoritarian about Mo's morality. We can see this most clearly in his fascinating parable about the origins of, and the necessity for, the state. Through the parable Mo set out a political argument supercially similar to that of Thomas Hobbes almost two millennia later. Both Mo and Hobbes saw humans, in the state of nature prior to the creation of society, as living in a condition of constant warfare. But where Hobbes saw conict as arising out of the untrammelled pursuit of self-interest, Mo saw it as the consequence of discord over values. 'Before there were any laws or governments, every man's view of things was dierent,' wrote Mo. 'One man had one view, two people had two views, ten men had ten views - the more men, the more views. Moreover, each man believed that his" ([Malik 2014:124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=124))

"own views were correct and disapproved of those of others.' As a result people were 'unable to live in harmony' and 'people all resorted to water, re, and poison in an eort to do each other" ([Malik 2014:125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=125))

"jury'.vercome this disorder, 'the most worthy and able man in the world was selected and set up as Son of Heaven'. There could be only one standard of morality in this state, based on the principles that 'What the superior considers right, all shall consider right. What the superior considers wrong, all shall consider wrong', and 'Always agree with the superior; never follow the inferior'.12 This Mo calls 'conforming upwards'. Mo's state is absolutist, and the authority of its ruler absolute." ([Malik 2014:125](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=125))

"ilosophy. If Confucianism was the yin, Daoism was the yang.ms of shamanism and folk religions. It expressed as much an attitude and a way of life as a philosophy, and its threads can be found in many religions and worldviews. Its formal roots lie in two literary classics. The rst is Dao De Jing, a book that, with the Analects, is regarded as the highest peak of classical Chinese literature. By tradition the Dao De Jing was written by Lao Tzu in the sixth century BCE" ([Malik 2014:126](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=126))

"'great master', is probably a gure of myth. The book was most likely compiled some two centuries later; the earliest copy we possess today dates from around 200 BCE. The second classic Daoist work is the eponymously titled Chuang Tzu. Unlike Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu was a historical gure, who lived at the end of the fourth century BCE. How much of the book, if any, he actually wrote is unknown." ([Malik 2014:127](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=127))

"velations throughout history.n, the ideal Buddhist is the arhat ('worthy one') who has lost the fetters of ordinary existence, such as belief in the self or a desire for sex, a 'person all of whose impurities are dissolved', and 'who has laid down his burden, attained his goal, and freed his mind through perfect understanding'.16 He has, in other words, achieved nirvana. The Mahayana ideal is the bodhisattva, or 'enlightened being', who has gained enlightenment but voluntarily postpones his or her nal entry into nirvana until everyone else has also become enlightened. The arhat seeks only his liberation, the bodhisattva the liberation of all. In Theravada only monks can achieve buddhahood; in Mahayana all can potentially do so. It is a more social gospel, evincing greater compassion for the poor and the needy. For Mahayanas, compassion ranked equally with wisdom as a means of achieving salvation. More exible about the demands of scripture, more willing to adapt the Buddha's teachings to local sensitivities, more attuned to social needs, it was unsurprisingly Mahayana Buddhism that travelled better beyond the boundaries of India. Virtually all Buddhist communities outside India - in Nepal, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, Japan and China - are Mahayanan." ([Malik 2014:129](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=129))

For Zhu, li meant not just propriety, the obligatory order of social relations and the rituals and etiquette necessary to maintain that order. It meant also the essence of an object or phenomenon. It is what makes a thing that which it is. Li is the 'dogness' that makes a dog a dog or the 'bookness' that makes a book a book. A book is a book because it embodies the essence of a book and not that of a dog or a rose or a chair." ([Malik 2014:132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=132))

"ok and not that of a dog or a rose or a chair.i. Li gives the dog its dogness, a book its bookness. Qi is the material that makes manifest the dogness and the bookness, that turns the abstract essence into an actual dog or a book.

It is abstract, beyond time and space, the source of things and forces and phenomena in the universe. 'The Supreme Ultimate', Zhu wrote, 'is what is highest of all, beyond which nothing can be. It is the most high, most mystical, and most abstruse, surpassing everything.'17 Zhu's Supreme Ultimate is reminiscent of the Dao as Daoists understood it," ([Malik 2014:132](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=132))

"In humans, li was, for Zhu, the essence of being human; it was, in other words, the abstract expression of human nature. As such, the li for all humans was the same. Li, Zhu insisted, 'is nothing but good, for since it is Li, how could it be evil?' So why are some humans bad? Why does evil exist? Because, argues Xhu, li - human nature - has to be embodied in qi - the material or force that actually makes up a human individual. 'Those who receive a Qi that is clear are the sages in whom the nature is like a pearl lying in clear cold water. But those who receive a Qi that is turbid are foolish and degenerate in whom nature is like a pearl lying in muddy water" ([Malik 2014:133](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=133))

"Two themes dominated Muhammad's Revelations: the religious and the social. Humanity's destiny, Muhammad insisted, lies with God and one is lost if one thinks otherwise. The name that Muhammad gave his God - Allah - was the name by which Arabs already knew their god. He was, however, not a tribal deity, but a universal power. There was, for Muhammad, only one God, omniscient, omnipotent, yet, in the words of the opening sura, 'compassionate' and 'merciful'. Muhammad's new kind of God demanded not simply submission (the literal meaning of Islam) but also a new kind of society. Like Jesus on the Mount, Muhammad, in some parts of the Revelation at least, denounces the actions and attitudes of the rich and the powerful and decries the mistreatment and exploitation of the weak and the oppressed" ([Malik 2014:141](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=141))

The Shi'atu Ali ('the party of Ali') wished to restrict the caliphate to Muhammad's descendants. The Sunnis emerged in part out of another early power bloc, the Shi'atu Uthman ('the party of Uthman'), that took a more pragmatic view, arguing that leadership should be vested with those politically most capable of maintaining order and stability in the ummah."

So a new class of religious scholars emerged to perform that function. The ulama or 'learned ones' took upon themselves the responsibility of guiding the ummah according to God's will. They came to hold extraordinary power in shaping the beliefs and practices of the Muslim community. The ulama wielded its power in a dierent way to Christian clergy. In Christianity, faithfulness was dened primarily through correct belief, hence the fractious debates and schisms over doctrines such as the divinity of Christ and the nature of the Trinity. Belief is clearly important within Islam, too, but faithfulness is dened less by right belief than by correct practice. It is a distinction between what philosophers call orthodoxic and orthopraxic faiths. The one and only belief required of a convert to Islam is simple - 'There is no god but God, and Muhammad is God's messenger'. Al-Ghazali, one of the most important philosophers of traditional Islam, set out three basic beliefs that could not be challenged: belief in a single God; belief in the Qur'an as God's word" ([Malik 2014:147](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=147))

"There was during the Abbasid period (750-1258) an extraordinary ourishing of freethinking, of a kind unseen since the height of Greek philosophy, and that would be unseen again until the Enlightenment. Dubbed ziddiqs, or 'heretics', by the authorities, many posed an open challenge to Islamic dogma. The most celebrated of the freethinkers was Abul Ala al-Ma'arri (c973-1058), sometimes known as the Eastern Lucretius for his uninching religious scepticism: They all errâ€”Moslems, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians: Humanity follows two world-wide sects: One, man intelligent without religion, The second, religious without intellect.5 Born in Syria, al-Ma'arri was struck down at an early age by smallpox, which was eventually to lead to blindness. He is one of the greatest poets in the Arab tradition. His most famous work, The Epistle of Forgiveness, in which he describes visiting paradise and meeting Arab poets of the pagan period, bears comparison to Dante's Divine Comedy. Not Revelation, nor tradition nor authority but only reason, alMa'arri insisted, should guide human life: Traditions come from the past, of high import if they be True; Ay, but weak is the chain of those who warrant their truth. Consult thy reason and let perdition take others all: Of all the conference Reason best will counsel and guide. Religion, al-Ma'arri insisted, was like a 'pasture full of noxious weeds', a 'fable invented by the ancients', to hold the masses in thrall:" ([Malik 2014:158](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=158))

"Ibn Rushd and al-Ma'arri represented the two poles of the Rationalist worldview, the one establishing reason as the equal of Revelation, the other dismissing Revelation in its entirety.

Appointed to the prestigious Nizamiyya Madrassa in Baghdad, he published a series of books challenging the falsafah school. What distinguished alGhazali from the myriad other critics of falsafah was his use of the method of the faylasufs to attack the content of their arguments. Rationalist claims about God, the cosmos and human nature, he insisted, were wanting in reason." ([Malik 2014:160](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=160))

The ultimate goal of the seeker of truth was the pure beatic experience that comes with the annihilation of the self and its absorption into God. Reading Su literature, al-Ghazali writes in his autobiography, made him realize that both theological convictions and good deeds were by themselves insucient for gaining redemption in the afterlife. Good spiritual being was necessary too. This conviction led al-Ghazali to write his masterpiece, The Revival of the Religious Sciences, a comprehensive guide to ethical behaviour in everyday life."

Since there was no point in designing rules of conduct to get humans into the next world, such rules could reect the needs of this one. Hence the Reformation created the possibility of a secular space dened by laws that defended political rather than divine order. It was an argument that clearly appealed to monarchs and princes chang at the constraints imposed by Papal power. By the thirteenth century the Church had achieved an unprecedented level of political authority in Western Europe. It was also riddled with corruption, shot through with sleaze, and had become a machine for minting money and grasping power. In 1492 Pope Alexander VI, a member of the Borgia family, had artfully bribed his way to the Papacy, despite having several mistresses and at least seven known illegitimate children. Forty years earlier, Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy had managed to get his eight-year-old son appointed as the Bishop of Geneva. If the higher clergy were lacking in any sense of moral virtue, the lower clergy were of ten illiterate, uncouth and ignorant. Little wonder that huge resentments had built up against Papal power. The so-called 'magisterial Protestantism', the Protestant rebellion led by the elite, swept through much of Northern and Central Europe, from the Swiss cantons, and the German-speaking lands of the Holy Roman Empire, to Bohemia, Poland and the Baltic states to the east and through the Netherlands to England to the north."

As kings and princes cleaved to the Reformation as a means of gaining power, so the institutions of faith and the institutions by which they enforced their rule became barely distinguishable.

"in his most famous work,y Discourse on Method. Published in 1637 It contains perhaps the best known line in all of philosophy: cogito ergo sum. 'I think, therefore I am.' Paradoxically, Descartes observed, the very fact that he was able to doubt revealed the one thing of which he could be sure: that he existed, and existed as an entity that could think. For if he doubted, he must exist in order to doubt." ([Malik 2014:205](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=205))

"much of modern thinking about humanf nature and our moral lives. ning feature of a human being and as a means of acquiring truth. Prior to Descartes, scholars discussed reason as a general condition of being, not as the product of an individual's mind. When Descartes writes that 'I' did this or that, he does so in a much more modern sense - as a personal reection on his thoughts and the workings of his own mind. The Discourse is written almost as a narrative, with Descartes himself as the hero, in search of the Holy Grail of truth. With Descartes the mind became fully interior and the private possession of the individual. If human beings were thinking substances, nature was a machine. This was the second principle that permeated the work of Descartes. It was a view in direct contrast to that of Aristotle, for whom the cosmos was more like an organism than a machine. In the new philosophy articulated by Descartes the teleological view of nature was banished. The Aristotelian universe, full of purpose and desire, gave way to an inert universe composed of purposeless particles each pursuing its course mindless of others.

"safety, to 'be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself'.7 This is the covenant between all citizens out of which society is born. To police the covenant, people transfer their rights, save that of self-defence, to a central power that ensures that no one reneges on their agreement to limit their own rights, and is able to enforce law by punishment. This central authority Hobbes calls the Commonwealth. The supreme ruler is himself not party to the covenant and so is incapable of breaching it. Such a sovereign is the source of law and property rights in the new society, and it is his function to enforce the covenant and protect his subjects. Hobbes accepted that the supreme power could be an 'Assembly of men' or of 'one Man'. But even an assembly would be no democracy. The power of the ruler, whether an individual or an assembly, had to be absolute. The only liberty a subject possessed was the liberty to do anything not regulated by the sovereign. Even in society, however, the right of every individual to self-preservation is absolute. If the sovereign threatens this right to self-preservation, then the subject had 'the Liberty to disobey'. Hobbes was the rst of the modern 'social contract' theorists, for whom society is created through voluntary agreement between its members."

The most signicant transformation, for Spinoza, was from being a slave to one's passions to being an agent of one's change. The development of human powers becomes the end of moral and political life. This vision of human transformation not only distinguished Spinoza from Hobbes but also made him the patron saint - if anyone so Godless could be described as a patron saint - of the radical wing of the intellectual storm that was to sweep through eighteenth-century Europe: the Enlightenment."

This was, of course, a self-serving denition, and one that airily dismissed pre-Enlightenment intellectual traditions upon many of which the philosophes drew, but it was also one that gave a sense of the historical signicance of the Enlightenment."

The two divided, according to Israel, on the question of whether reason reigned supreme in human aairs, as the Radicals insisted, or whether reason had to be limited by faith and tradition - the view of the mainstream. This distinction, Israel suggests, was to shape the attitudes of the two sides to a whole host of social and political issues such as equality, democracy and colonialism. The mainstream's intellectual timidity constrained, in Israel's view, its critique of old social forms and beliefs. By contrast, the Radical Enlightenment 'rejected all compromise with the past and sought to sweep away existing structures entirely'. The Radicals were driven to pursue their ideas of equality and democracy to their logical conclusions because, having broken with traditional concepts of a God-ordained order, there was no 'meaningful alternativeÂ  â€¦Â  to grounding morality, political and social order on a systematic radical egalitarianism extending across all frontiers, class barriers and horizons'.

"lia as well as in America, even if we have not been to either place. n the behaviour of entities in the observed present will persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. But, Hume insisted, we cannot rationally justify that belief. It is not reason but natural instinct, the given way our minds work, that leads us to make such inferences. Similarly with causation. Just as humans have a tendency to search for regularities in the world, so they have a tendency to see the world in terms of cause and eect. However, as with inductive inference, our perception of causation is, Hume insists, a product of the way our minds work, not of the external world. Ideas of necessary causation, as Hume puts it, are 'qualities of perceptions, not of objects, and are internally felt by the soul, and not perceiv'd externally in bodies'.3" ([Malik 2014:223](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZZPVZWDR?page=223))

He does not argue, however, that values cannot derive from the facts of the world, nor that there is an unbridgeable chasm between facts and values. Distinctions between good and evil, right and wrong, were, for Hume, the products not of reason but of a moral sense. But moral sense was itself a natural disposition, an aspect of human nature. Indeed, Hume claims that 'no action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be in human nature some motive to produce it, distinct from the sense of its morality'."
