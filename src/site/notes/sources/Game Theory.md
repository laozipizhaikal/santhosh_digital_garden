# Rules of Game
Rules have to specify 4 things
1. **Who** is playing
2. **What** are they playing with - the alternative actions, or choices, the strategies, that each player has available
3. **When** each player gets to play - in what order
4. **How** much they stand to gain (or lose) from the choices made in the game

*Assume [[Notes/Common Knowledge\|Common Knowledge]] about the rule*
