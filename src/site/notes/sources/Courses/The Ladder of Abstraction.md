### The writing Constellation
Multiple disciples involved in any public policy matter -- define who you are 

**Constellation** - *Disciplines*
**Strategic** - *Analysis*
**Tactical** - *Parameters*
**Field** - *Implement*

**Constellation** - *Disciplines*  - a full field.. environmental issues - policy level changes
**Strategic** - *Analysis* - how many affected,  
**Tactical** - *Parameters* - measurable change in parameter.. numbers.. transportation 
**Field** - *Implement* - what we do .. buses  
Where do margins lie here? At strategic and Tactical 

Where does your ideas and actions lie?
Realms of the Abstract
Theoretical Discipline
Experimental Design
Field Improvements

> “You gain comprehensiveness as you climb the ladder but you lose the ability to form concrete images. But you’ve traded specificity for something that also has value. If you can generalize about a larger class, you have knowledge that you can apply in a variety of situations so greater meaning resides on the ladder’s upper rungs. Good writing constantly ascends and descends the ladder of abstraction.” - Storycraft, Jack Hart

Consider a ladder . Just as the ladder rests on solid ground, **the bottom of the ladder** of abstraction represents **concrete things**:

-   peanut butter and jam sandwiches
-   your goldfish Harry
-   a 2011 Honda Civic painted “tango red pearl”
-   broken leg bones
-   velcro straps on winter jackets
-   fresh loaves of rye bread right out of the oven
-   kisses from your mother

Conversely, **the top of the ladder** of abstraction is for **abstract ideas and concepts**:

-   democracy
-   freedom
-   justice
-   wealth
-   truth

The **middle rungs of the ladder** store things which are not entirely concrete, and yet not entirely abstract:

-   livestock
-   educational institutions
-   classical music
-   organizational charts

To be an effective speaker, you must “climb up and down the ladder of abstraction” to borrow a phrase Roy Peter Clark uses in [_Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316014990/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316014990&linkCode=as2&tag=6mcite-20 "Examine book details"). Audiences need both concrete details _and_ abstract principles and lessons. To make a persuasive argument and establish a powerful rhythm, balance your speech between the two. Move up and down the ladder (and spend some time in the middle, if appropriate), making your message more understandable for the audience at many different levels.

### How to Climb Down the Ladder of Abstraction

If your speeches or presentations have too much theory and highly abstract concepts, you can achieve balance by injecting content at a low level of abstraction. Here are a few ways to do this:

1.  Embrace the phrase “**For example…**” .  
    Provide real-world tangible examples for your theories and ideas.
2.  Use **sensory language**.  
    Help your audience see, touch, hear, taste, and smell.
3.  **Be specific**.  
    Provide ample details.
4.  Tell **stories** and **anecdotes**.  
    Stories add emotion and realism to any theory.
5.  Cite **data**, **statistics**, and **case studies**.  
    They offer support for your theories.
6.  Feature **photographs and props**.  
    Remember that _all_ words are a higher level of abstraction compared to the real thing. Use the real thing.
7.  Have a strong **call-to-action**.  
    Show your audience how to put your message into practice.
8.  Answer **“How?” questions**.  
    Questions like “How does this work?” force you to more concrete explanations.

### How to Climb Up the Ladder of Abstraction

If your speeches tend to get lost in the details, climb up the ladder periodically. Here are a few strategies you can use to get there:

1.  Answer “**Why is this important?**”  
    Give the deeper meaning behind the concrete facts and data.
2.  Provide the **big picture**.  
    Explain the context and orient your audience.
3.  Reveal **patterns and relationships**.  
    Help your audience see how the ideas connect — both to other ideas and their lives.
4.  Draw **diagrams**.  
    Help your audience form mental models of processes, objects, etc.
5.  Use appropriate **charts**.  
    Go beyond pure data to show trends.
6.  Reveal the **lesson**.  
    Follow every story or case study with the key insights.
7.  Draw **inferences**.  
    Apply sound logic to generalize from particular cases.
8.  Summarize into **principles and guidelines**.  
    Help the audience learn from your experience by providing principles they can use.
9.  Appeal to **shared ideals**.  
    Draw connections between your message and the ideals held by your audience, such as justice, truth, liberty, or freedom
