# The Building Blocks of Writing

## Styles of Writing Pieces
### Shallow and Readable Tabloid Style
- Single sentence in a paragraph. 
- Each sentence going **forward**
- Visually small 
- Constructed as a sausage - if you cut the last sentence / last paragraph there is no change in structure. 
- Editors tend to cut the piece from the bottom
### Mainstream
- shorter and less sensational headlines
- paragraphs not short, more information
- Still You can cut from the bottom
- Sentences ended well - emphatic note
### Long-read Style
- Each Sentence is going **deeper** 
- Captive audience 
### New Yorker
- Go deep into background 
- Set Context and information - deeper? 
- Place context and facts correctly in a way, no need to make our argument, the reader can come to the same conclusion. 
### New York Times Editorial Style
- Stated Opinion 
- put some facts
### New York Times Op Ed Style
- Conversational 
- Good reference 

> A news story is a string of Sausages; it can be cut from the bottom. A feature is a salad; so is a match. A think piece is a Soup - #TimDeLisle  

#### **Salil Tripathi Method**
- Pick a subject you can write an Op Ed about today 
- Write down 5 to 8 sentences outlining the points you will cover in the piece 
- now make each of them the first sentence of a paragraph and write the piece 
Some of them can be more than one para
## Sentence
- *Sentence length*
- *Punctuation*
- *Structure*
- *Emphasis*

1. Simplify
2. Keep Subject + Verb together or as close as possible. 
3. The 2-3-1 rule -> interesting - boring - most interesting.
4. Look for Rhythmic Patterns
