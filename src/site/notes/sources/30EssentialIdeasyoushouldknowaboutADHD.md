# 1. Developmental Disorder - Failure to Develop
 Chronic delay in developmental traits - quantitative differences Failing to develop on schedule
## 1.1. Inhibition
not suppressing irrelevant behaviour 
cognitive impulsiveness 
symptom - restlessness - gross motor activity and cognitive restlessness - internal restlessness 
affects emotions - **emotional impulsiveness** - not a mood disorder - 
mood disorder - generating too much emotion

ADHD - display emotions quickly - failure to regulate normal emotions - self regulation issues - to self sooth to self calm - quickness to emote 
modify the emotion to be more acceptable for the context - socially acceptable less damaging 
inability to manage frustration impatience and anger 

closely linked to oppositional defiant disorder (ODD1.1.2 inability to make close friendships 
	Impact - 
	inability to make and keep close sustained friendships with other children

caused by emotional impulsiveness - quickness with which one emote - inhibitory issues 

## 1.2. Attention Deficit - Executive Deficits
 3 interacting attentional problems - better to be taught of as executive deficits and not attention deficits 

there are at least 6 or 7 kinds of attention and supporting networks in human brain. they are all not disrupted by this disorder. 

We need to know which one… ADHD is not the only attention deficit 

### 1.2.1. Failure to Develop Persistence towards a Goal

Attention disorder in ADHD is well defined as failure to persistence

It involves
	behaviour
	motivation and
	the future

It is not lack of Perception, Filtering, Processing etc.  
these are other types of steps involved in attention that is not affected in ADHD. 

nature of inattentiveness in ADHD is unique - failure of **persistence**

problem with motor part of brain 

#### 1.2.1.1. Motivation
can you sustain action towards a goal adequately to attain it  

#### 1.2.1.2. Failure to Direct Behaviour forward in time
	failure to direct behaviour foreward in time 
	can not presist towards these delayed end points in life

### 1.2.2 Resist Distraction
Not a perceptual issue - a motor issue. 

A person with ADHD have no problem perceiving a distractors compared to others but *they respond to distractors more than others* - inhibitory failure   

compelled to react 

distraction provoke a response and the response can not be inhibited 

### 1.2.1. Ability to Reengage / Working Memory
person with ADHD is far less likely to reengage the incomplete goal  

This is not of attention, this is a *working memory disorder*. 
there is more than inattention

Working memory is one of the 5 executive functions

Working memory - remember what we were doing.. forget what the goal was.. working memory helps in reengage with the goal

ADHD forgets the goal and anything else compelling will capture their behavious  

hence the symptom - **skips from one incompleted activity to another**  
# 2. Self Regulation
ADHD must be looked at as **Self Regulatory Developmental Disorder** - this is a serious issue

A lot of profound human traits are not developing  

What is self regulation?
  Ability to 
  consciously and wilfully
  choose to inhibit your behaviour and then 
  engage in series of **self directed** actions 

actions to - long term self improvement .. long term welfare… delayed consequences 

Self Control 
is not learnt
not from parenting 
it is neurogenetic 

Our capacity to regulate ourself is a neurobiological trait and not socially learnt

not due to lack of training.. it had to do with brain development. 

training can enhance / shape them but these do not originate in training 

inability in self directed activities follows from the impairment in following 5 executive functions 
## 2.1. Inhibition
Can you stop / wait / pause btw event and what you plan to do about it - response | stimulus response - dont you think 
## 2.2. Non Verbal Working Memory - Visual Imagery
Mental imaginary - recall past - visual imaginary system - can not visualise relevant past - lack hindsight - no foresight - not thinking ahead 
## 2.3. Verbal Working Memory - Self Speech
Can not talk to yourself - voice in head - help control oneself - at age 5 child start talking with oneself out loud and over time the speech is internalised and made private and mental - tells one what to do - they can not follow instructions, can not follow rules cannot internalise the rules
## 2.4. Emotional Control
Ability to manage emotions - to be more socially acceptable, consistent with goals and not conflicting with welfare - ADHD child easily frustrated, quick to anger, more emotional more excitable - minds heart
   
   Emotions are the source of Motivations.. if you can not manage your emotions you can not manage your motivations - self motivation is the fuel tank for future directed behavious
   
   So they can not rely on self motivation for their actions - can not motivate themselves
   
   Always dependent on the environment around them and its immediate consequences for how hard and how long you can work
   
   if there is not consequence you can not work - can not persist 
   
   video games provides 100% external continuous consequences 

  Consequences are delayed in real life - failure

  this is not a choice, not wilful, this is an internal neurogenerative executive failure

## 2.5 Planning and Problem Solving
 minds play ground 
 how many solutions can you think of to circumvent a problem
 stimulate multiple possible future options 

How quickly in your mind can you think of multiple ways to overcome the problem you just encountered 

These 5 things are impacted 

ADHD leads you to act on impulse, not resist distraction, less able to think back etc.. live in the moment

**rob you of sense of time**

**disorder of time management** 

# 3. Types of ADHD

DSM is not accurate.. 
2 types 
1. with conduct disorder
2. without conduct disorder

differentiation from SCT - Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT)

ADHD is productivity disorder 

# 4. Causation

all biological  

social factors
- resources available to treat
- impairments are part of situation
- comorbidity 

One third acquired - not generic
mainly during pregnancy 
disrupt development of frontal lobe
5% due to causes that affect ongoing brain development - trauma infection 

lead poisoning 
steps bacteria 
lukemia 

frontal part of the brain is small 
some brain regions are smaller 

5 regions impact ADHD
right frontal lobe
basel ganglia
cerebellum
anterier cingulare
corpus callosum 

these regions are 3% to 10% smaller in children with ADHD 

⅓rd males might have acquired the disorder 

Profoundly genetic

# 5. Important Insights

## 5.1 Time Blindness

live in the now 

the now is more compelling than the information you are holding in your mind

frontal lobe - organise behavious across time in anticipation of future 

nearsightedness to future 
only deal with things near in time 
only deal with last minute 

## 5.2 Build Pyramids of Behaviour

can not hierarchialy organise behavious 
can not create bigger goal to biggeer goal 
inability to organise behaviour across time into a hierarchy
ability to look ahead - intention 
IDD.. intention deficit disorder 
inability to organise around the intentions not insincierity / not intent 

brain
back - acquire knowledge
front - performance .. use knowledge
ADHD - performance disorder 

have all skills but can not use them 

what to do?
- stop teaching skills 
- change point of performance 
- increase accountability - increase the frequency, immediacy salience & timing of the consequence 
- all natural consequence are delayed 

all behaviour modifications are equal to ramps in the building

behaviour modifications are not for teaching / not instructional they are motivational 

they will need more frequent consequences around them 

care givers are the most important part of the treatment 

chronic disorder 
goal - to manage it; create reduction in symptom.. reduce secondary harm 

Consequences
- can not stop & hold things in mind - need external physical forms of reminder - substitute for working memory - externalise - outside the brain in front of you - lists posters - journal immediate - that is your working memory 
- timer - something physical to indicate passage of time -
- day planner - week at a glance - timer and calander dependent / addict - you can not see the future coming at youso if anything you have agreed to do - you have to break it into baby steps and do it daily - break the future in pieces and do it today 
- Keep the Events - Responses - Outcomes close together 
- little ERO bridges over time 
- All motivation is external 
- make problem solving manual - outside -
